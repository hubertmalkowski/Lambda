; Church numerals - encoding numbers as functions
; Church numeral n = λf.λx. f(f(...f(x)...)) (n times)

let succ_num = fun n -> succ n in
let zero = fun f -> fun x -> x in
let one = fun f -> fun x -> f x in
let two = fun f -> fun x -> f (f x) in
let three = fun f -> fun x -> f (f (f x)) in

; Convert church numeral to integer by applying succ_num
