; Example demonstrating lazy evaluation difference
; Run with --lazy to see lazy evaluation in action
; In strict mode, both branches are evaluated
; In lazy mode, only the taken branch is evaluated

let expensive_computation (x : Int) = succ (succ (succ x)) in
let true_branch = expensive_computation 100 in
let false_branch = expensive_computation 200 in

; With --lazy: only true_branch is computed
; Without --lazy: both branches are computed before if
if iszero 0 then true_branch else false_branch
