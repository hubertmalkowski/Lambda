; Church numeral addition
; add m n = m succ_num (n succ_num 0)
; This applies successor m times to (n as integer)

let succ_num = fun n : Int -> succ n in
let suc = fun n : ((Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int)) -> fun f : (Int -> Int) -> fun x : Int -> f (n f x) in
let two = fun f : (Int -> Int) -> fun x : Int -> f (f x) in
let three = suc two in
let add = fun m : ((Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int)) -> fun n : ((Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int)) -> m succ_num (n succ_num 0) in

; 2 + 3 = 5
add two three
