; Church numeral addition
; add m n = m succ_num (n succ_num 0)
; This applies successor m times to (n as integer)

let succ_num (n : Int) = succ n in
let suc (n : ((Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int))) (f : (Int -> Int)) (x : Int) = f (n f x) in
let two (f : (Int -> Int)) (x : Int) = f (f x) in

let add (m : ((Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int))) (n : ((Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int))) = m succ_num (n succ_num 0) in

; 2 + 3 = 5
add two three
